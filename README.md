# Web Archive

This repo is a digital time capsule of my past web experiments, school projects, and forgotten side quests in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Most of these were built years ago and are kept here for archival purposes, nostalgia, and the occasional laugh. Hosted via GitHub Pages for easy access.

No guarantees on code quality â€” just raw, unfiltered history.
