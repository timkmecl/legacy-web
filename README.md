# Web Archive

This repo is a digital time capsule of my past web experiments, school projects, and forgotten side quests in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Most of these were built years ago and are kept here for archival purposes, nostalgia, and the occasional laugh. Hosted via GitHub Pages for easy access.

No guarantees on code quality â€” just raw, unfiltered history.

## Projects

### [Complex Plane](complex-plane/)
**Description:** A simple interactive visualization of the complex plane. Allows plotting points by clicking on the canvas, and adding grids and parameters.
**Usage:** Click anywhere on the canvas area to plot a point representing a complex number (x-axis for real part, y-axis for imaginary part). Write a function at the top, and add a grid on the left side.

### [Mandelbrot](mandelbrot/)
**Description:** An interactive viewer for the Mandelbrot set fractal. Features zooming capabilities to explore the intricate details of the set.
**Usage:** Use mouse buttons and arrow keys to zoom in and out of different regions of the Mandelbrot set displayed on the canvas. Hit space to animate the colors.

### [Taylor-Gauss](taylor-gauss/)
**Description:** A mathematical visualization tool demonstrating Taylor series approximations of the Gaussian function.



### [Tarca](tarca/)
**Description:** A browser-based game built with a custom JavaScript game engine. Includes basic game menus like main menu, options, and leaderboards, along with media assets (multiplayer is not functional here).
**Usage:** Use the mouse to navigate the game menus. Start the game from the main menu option. You get a points for clicking on the target, and lose points if you miss.

### [Triangle](triangle/)
**Description:** A concept for a browser-based game, potentially multiplayer, involving triangles. Features elements like login screens and leaderboards. The networking aspect might be conceptual or require a specific backend setup (not included).
**Usage:** Click anywhere on the screen to make the triangle accelerate in the direction it is pointing. Avoid crashing into squares and sides.
